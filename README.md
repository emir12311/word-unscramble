# Word Unscramble Game 🔤  

This is my **fourth Python project**, made during school.  
It’s a simple word unscrambling game where you try to guess the original word from its scrambled version.  

## How the game works  
1. The program randomly picks a word from a list.  
2. It scrambles the letters in the word.  
3. You try to guess the original word.  
4. The program tells you if you were correct or not.  
5. You can play as many rounds as you like until you press Enter to quit.  

## What I learned while making it  
- Using `random.shuffle()` to scramble lists.  
- Converting a list of letters back into a string with `"".join()`.  
- Handling user input and comparing it in a **case-insensitive** way.  
- Controlling loops to allow multiple rounds of the game.  

### Note 📝  
Like my other projects, this is the **first version only**.  
I’m not improving or rewriting it unless it’s something really special.  
This GitHub is meant to show my growth over time, from my earliest code to whatever I make in the future.
